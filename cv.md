## About me
Hello, my name is Oxana. I am 33 years old. I am an engineer. I design some constructions and mechanisms. I work with steel and other materials. I like my job, but I want to upgrade my skills. I want to develop all of my life.
Web programming is constantly growing and changing. I think that I can be part of it. That is the main reason why I’ve decided to try something new (rs school). I want to gain some knowledge in the front-end. And my goal is to become a junior JS developer.

  line = String(line);
  const len = line.length;
  const lin = len / 2;
  let i = 0;
  if (len < 2) {
    return true;
  }
  while (i <= Math.floor(lin)) {
    if (line[i] !== line[(len - i) - 1]) {
      return false;
    } else {
      return true;
    };
  };
};
